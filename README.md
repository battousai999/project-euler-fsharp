# project-euler-fsharp
This project contains my implementations of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in the programming languare [F#](https://fsharp.org/) (which I started in order to practice writing code in F#).

Project Euler is an ever-expanding collection of computational, largely mathematical programming problems that vary in difficulty from relatively easy to very difficult.
